### For My First Trick...

You will be working in a group this semester. You will develop a project, gather measures, find background literature, collect data, analyze results, all culminating in a final paper.

How do *you* think groups should be decided?

1.  What if we clustered groups together by GPA? (consider using means clustering from `{cluster}` package.

```{r}
meth1 <- 
  data.frame(
  student = 1:20,
  gpa = c(rnorm(5,3.4,.3),
              rnorm(5,3.0,.3),
              rnorm(5,2.2,1),
              rnorm(5,2.5,.5))
) 

cluster::agnes(meth1, metric = "euclidean", method = "average")
```

2.  What if we sorted groups alphabetically?

```{r}
df_test <- 
  data.frame(
  student = paste0(
    sample(babynames$name,30), " ", sample(LETTERS,30,replace = T), "."
))

num_gr <- 5

colname <- paste0("Group ", 1:5)

df_abc <- 
  df_test |> 
  group_by((row_number()-1) %/% (n()/num_gr)) |> 
  tidyr::nest()

df_abc_d <- 
  df_abc$data |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  hux() |> 
  theme_article()

df_abc_d[1,1:5] <- colname

df_abc_d |> 
  set_left_border() |> 
  set_caption("Study Groups")

```

```{r}

num_gr <- 5

colname <- paste0("Group ", 1:5)

df <- 
  df_test |> 
  group_by((row_number()-1) %/% (n()/num_gr)) |> 
  tidyr::nest()

df_t <- 
  df$data |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  hux() |> 
  theme_article()

df_t[1,1:5] <- colname

df_t |> 
  set_left_border() |> 
  set_caption("Study Groups")
```

3.  What if each group was assigned a letter of A,B,C,D, or E?

```{r}
df_test |> 
  mutate(lettergrp = sample(LETTERS[1:5],length(student),replace = T),
         lettergrp = factor(lettergrp))

  
```

These are all methods of *assignment* which we will cover later on in lecture!

### Identifying a Research Topic

Take 5 minutes and brainstorm with your group.

It can help to first identify the *field* in which you (and your group) are interested. For example, if you are interested in Sports Psychology, you might think about how exercise or coaching can effect how a player performs on any given game.

### Search for the topic!

You can use the Farmingdale Databases or my personal favorite, Google Scholar. When you find an article you like, click on *Cited By* to see recent studies that have included the current study in their references.

### Defining Variables

1.  What is your Independent Variable
2.  What is your Dependent Variable
3.  What is/are your operational definition(s)
4.  What is/are your conceptual definition(s)
