For example, if you are interested in Sports Psychology, you might think about how exercise or coaching can effect how a player performs on any given game.\n\n6.0.3 Search for the topic!\nYou can use the Farmingdale Databases or my personal favorite, Google Scholar. When you find an article you like, click on Cited By to see recent studies that have included the current study in their references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Library\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: \n\n\n\n\n6.0.4 Connected Papers\n\n\nConnected Papers: Visualize Article Connections\n\n\n\n6.0.5 Defining Variables\n\nWhat is your Independent Variable\nWhat is your Dependent Variable\nWhat is/are your operational definition(s)\nWhat is/are your conceptual definition(s)\n\n6.0.6 Group Experiment Planning Worksheet\n\n\n\n      \n         References\n                \n  \n  \n      \n        7  Lab 2: Conducting a Literature Search"
