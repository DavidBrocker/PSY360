```{r}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(ggplot2)
library(wesanderson)
library(tidyr)

sent <- sample(sentences,1)

sent
```

### How many characters?

```{r}
str_length(sent)
```

### How many words?

```{r}
length(unlist(str_match_all(sent, "\\b\\w+\\b")))
```

### How many words start with a vowel?

```{r}
sent_split <- unlist(str_split(sent, boundary(type = "word")))

str_extract(sent_split, "^[aeiou]\\w+" )

```

### How many words start with a consonant?

```{r}
sent_split <- unlist(str_split(sent, boundary(type = "word")))
# We only need to change one character!
str_extract(sent_split, "[^aeiou]\\w+" )
```
